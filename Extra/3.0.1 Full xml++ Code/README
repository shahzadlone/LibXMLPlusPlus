libxml++
-------------

This library provides a C++ interface to XML files. It uses libxml2 to access
the XML files, and in order to configure libxml++ you must have both libxml2 and
pkg-config installed.

To get the latest version of libxml++, see
http://libxmlplusplus.sourceforge.net/
To contact the developers, send e-mail to the mailing list at
http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/libxmlplusplus-list
We welcome patches, but it helps to discuss them first.

Read the file 'INSTALL' for instructions to compile and install the library.

See the examples directory for example code.

Use pkg-config to discover the necessary include and linker arguments. For
instance,
  pkg-config libxml++-3.0 --cflags --libs
Ideally you would use PKG_CHECK_MODULES in your configure.ac file.
